                <p>I’m currently in my second year of a graduate program in Information Experience Design at Pratt Institute. Previously, I studied Computer Science and Economics at McGill University, which gave me a solid analytical foundation and sharpened my strategic thinking skills. I believe that data and design make a perfect pair for problem-solving — data helps in strategizing and identifying problems, while design focuses on solving them.</p>
                <p>What truly drives me is using data and research to guide design decisions. I’m passionate about creating experiences that are intuitive, engaging, and aligned with both user needs and business goals. I am eager to bring my analytical skills, strategic mindset, and passion for user-centered design to help create compelling experiences for people.</p>
                <p>Outside of work and studies, I’m passionate about writing, from journaling to storytelling. I find that writing not only helps me process my thoughts but also connects me more deeply with my creative side. I also love spending time in nature, hiking and running. Being immersed in nature is incredibly refreshing and continually fuels my creativity and energy.
